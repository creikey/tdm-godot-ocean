# tdm-godot-ocean
(NO LICENSE YET) The TDM Seascape Shadertoy shader ported to godot: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1

## TODO
 - Waiting on an asset-store compatible license for the shader from https://www.shadertoy.com/user/TDM 
 - Procedurally generate ocean geometry with code from https://github.com/SIsilicon/Godot-Ocean-Demo
 - For this I think I need to have the mesh be unshaded then manually shade it with the sky color either fetched from a skybox like in the demo or from a panoramasky (see https://github.com/SIsilicon/Godot-Ocean-Demo/blob/master/Projected-grid.gd )
